Example session demonstrating the plan-first approach for feature development.

## Example Prompt: Dark/Light Theme Feature

```
Plan a new frontend feature:

- The app should support dark and light themes
- 3 options should be available to the user: system (default), dark, light
- The map itself should follow the app settings
- Suggest the best place to render the theme control component based on UX best practices
```
