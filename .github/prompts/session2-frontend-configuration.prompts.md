# Session 2: Frontend Configuration

## Prompt 1: Request comprehensive guide

```
Give me a comprehensive guide with best practices for developing a modern SPA using TypeScript and React. Cover the full frontend development flow, including compiling, linting, unit testing, and packaging. Focus only on the frontend part.
```

## Prompt 2: Adjust project configuration

```
Adjust the project configuration according to best practices
```

## Prompt 3: Revise instructions

```
Revise the instructions in #file:instructions and general #file:copilot-instructions.md. Update them with the guides you've created.

Do not reference FRONTEND_GUIDE.md and other files in the instructions. Create a new .github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md that contains relevant points from #file:FRONTEND_GUIDE.md. This instruction should apply to the whole ./frontend directory.

Do not repeat yourself across different instruction files; keep them focused and precise, and avoid conflicts across instructions.
```
